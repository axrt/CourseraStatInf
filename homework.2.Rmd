#2

Suppose that the number of web hits to a particular site are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 100 hits per day and a standard deviation of 10 hits per day. What's the probability that a given day has fewer than 93 hits per day expressed as a percentage to the nearest percentage point?

```{r 2}
pnorm(93, mean=100, sd=10)
```

```{r 3}
0.045/((0.045*0.95) - 0.95*0.88)
```

```{r 4}
round(qnorm(p = 0.95, mean = 100, sd = 10, lower.tail = TRUE))
```
